# Convolution-Neural-Networks

## Introduction
This project is focused on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image recognition. The model is designed to take in an image as input and classify it into different classes.

## Features
1. Utilizes the principles of CNNs, including neurons with learnable weights and biases, activation functions, and a loss function
2. Uses convolutional operations to transform the input image to extract more information
3. Implements pooling and dropout layers to reduce overfitting
4. Pre-processes and loads a dataset of 60000 training images and 10000 test images
5. Utilizes the Keras library for model assembly, optimization, and evaluation

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Tensorflow, Keras, and other necessary libraries

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/saicharan2002/Convolution-Neural-Networks.git
2. Install the necessary libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Provide the model with an image dataset
2. Pre-process and prepare the dataset for training and testing
3. Assemble and train the CNN model using the Keras library
4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss
5. Use the trained model to classify new images

## Visualization
The performance of the model can be visualized by using matplotlib to plot the number and its corresponding output.
